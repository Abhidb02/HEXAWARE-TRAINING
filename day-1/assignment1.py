# # # # # # 𝐷(𝑥)=100𝑥+150−50𝑥
# # # # # # D(x)=100x+150−50x
# # # # # # 𝐷(𝑥)=50𝑥+150
# # # # # # D(x)=50x+150
# # # # # so the total distance is 300  and therefore the half of it 150 it means the school has to build in between both village 
# # # # # which is 1.5km

# # # # ans3. Break the 2nd link.
# # # # On Day 1, give 1st link.
# # # # On Day 2, take back the 1st link and give the broken 2nd link.
# # # # On Day 3, give back the 1st link.
# # # # On Day 4, give 3rd link.
# # # # On Day 5, take back all and give 4th link.
# # # # On Day 6, give 5th and 6th links.

# # # if its 100 days then 
# # # (log2100)=(6.64)=6
# # # So 6 links need to be cut.

# ans5. Breakdown:
# Split: [6, 5, 1] and [4, 3, 2]
# Further split: [6] [5,1] and [4] [3,2]
# Split again: [5] [1] and [3] [2]
# Merge: [5,1] → [1,5], [3,2] → [2,3]
# Merge: [6,1,5] → [1,5,6], [4,2,3] → [2,3,4]
# Final merge: [1,5,6] + [2,3,4] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Sorted output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
